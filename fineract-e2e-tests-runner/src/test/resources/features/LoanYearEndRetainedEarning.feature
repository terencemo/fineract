  Scenario: Verify that year-end close zeroes income accounts into retained earnings, is idempotent and next year starts clean
    # --- Isolate this run: dedicated office + clear any prior FY2025 close (the job's idempotency guard is
    #     global by year-end date), so the suite is repeatable on the same database. ---
    Given any existing year-end retained earnings close for fiscal year ending "31 December 2025" is removed
    # --- Arrange: a loan recognising interest income (404000) and fee income (404007) in FY2025 ---
